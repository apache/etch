there are various options for timing of calls to the remote
interface and timing of the stub execution of the implementation:

say i have a service Foo.

Foo foo = new RemoteFoo( ... );

// straight call / return
int sum = foo.add( 1, 2 );

// caller returns immediately, later reads delayed answer...
Mailbox<Integer> mb = new ClientMailbox<Integer>();
foo.add( 1, 2, mb );
...
int sum = mb.next();
