#Home directory of the etch-router component, default value is "."

#The root directory where all the plugin group schema dir's/files are saved
#Default value is "<etch.router.home>/plugins"
#Each plugin-group will have a sub-directory under <plugins.root.dir>. The
#plugin-group subdirectory will contain one or multiple Etch XML binding
#file(s) that define a unique set of API's and types that will be implemented
#by the plugin-group member(s). The sub-directory may also contain a file
#named "metadata.txt" to indicate certain attributes of the plugin group. 
#In this metadata.txt, currently only one property "plugin.group.type" is 
#supported by etch router: it indicates the type of the plugin-group, 
#which could be: simple, failover or roundrobin

#The root directory where all the application schema dir's/files are saved
#Default value is "<etch.router.home>/applications"
#Each application will have a sub-directory under <applications.root.dir>.
#The application sub-directory will contain one or multiple Etch XML binding
#file(s) that define all the types and methods that the installed application
#references during its run-time.
