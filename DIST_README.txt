Welcome to the 1.0.1 release of Etch.

The jumping off point for Etch information and help is here:

(Please ignore the tantalizing navigation box on the right and instead
scroll down to view various topics...)

The top-level structure of the install image is:

	ChangeLog.txt
	LICENSE.txt
	README.txt
	bin
	lib

Please take a moment to review the ChangeLog.txt and LICENSE.txt files.

The Windows installer (etch-1.0.1-setup.exe) has created a user environment
variable (ETCH_HOME) which points to the Etch installation directory. If you
installed Etch using either etch-1.0.1.tar.gz or etch-1.0.1.zip, you will want
to create this environment variable yourself:

windows:
	set ETCH_HOME=C:\Program Files\Etch\etch-1.0.1

unix:
	export ETCH_HOME=/usr/local/etch/etch-1.0.1

The bin directory has also been put on your path by the Windows installer. If
you are using the archives, you will need to do this yourself:

windows:
	PATH %PATH%;%ETCH_HOME%\bin

unix:
	PATH="$PATH:$ETCH_HOME/bin"

The bin directory contains a Windows bat script and a unix shell script.

You will also need to have a java sdk installed (later versions of 1.5 or
any version of 1.6). A JAVA_HOME environment variable should point to the
installation directory of the java sdk.

In the end, at a command line or shell, you should be able to run the etch
compiler and see some basic output:

windows:
	C:\>etch
	etch: option '-b binding' must be specified on the command line

unix:
	bash-3.2$ etch
	etch: option '-b binding' must be specified on the command line

The lib directory contains the various jar files, zipped sources, and a C# dll:

	Etch.dll
	etch-ant-plugin-1.0.1-src.zip
	etch-ant-plugin-1.0.1.jar
	etch-java-runtime-1.0.1-src.zip
	etch-java-runtime-1.0.1.jar
	...

The main items of interest are the java binding runtime, which you need to
put on the classpath of your projects: etch-java-runtime-1.0.1.jar. There is
source code to go with it in etch-java-runtime-1.0.1-src.zip.

The C# (.NET 2.0) Etch.dll should be added to any C# projects.

Finally, there is an ant plugin which you can use with ant 1.7.0 or later to
invoke the compiler as a task. It is documented on the wiki referenced above.

Examples and unit tests can be had by checking out the source code from the
subversion repository and performing a complete build:
